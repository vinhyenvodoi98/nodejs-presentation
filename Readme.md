# Remote_Control_Presentation_Using_Nodejs

## Description

Wouldn't it be cool to use your smartphone as a remote control? It turns out it is not difficult at all! You don't even need to know how to write native mobile apps - your phone has a fully capable web browser with support for web sockets, which opens a lot of possibilities.
